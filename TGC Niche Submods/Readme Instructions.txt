This is a folder containing various additional submods you can use with TGC. They are moved here to declutter the launcher.

If you wish to use one of the submods from here, simply move the folder and .mod file (eg, TGCOrganizedStacks and TGCOrganizedStacks.mod) to the mod folder, Victoria II/mod/. Select them together with TGC in the launcher and run the game.

Additionally, you can download our music mod on https://github.com/joelAVS/The-Grand-Orchestra

TGC Countries Endonymic Localization - This is a submod that changes to all country names as they are called in their own languages, rather than plain english
TGC HFM Cultures Map Mode - This is a niche for those that prefer HFM culture map rather than TGC's
TGC Low Ram - This is a performance addon to help run your game faster, read instructions inside this folder to find out how to use it.
TGC Units - Organized Stacks - This is a submod that reorganizes major country armies to 4 infantry, 1 hussar and 5 artillery at game start, for those that prefer to avoid the annoyance of manually doing the reorganization
TGC Statehood Mechanic - This is a rudimentary submod that disallows countries to promote colonies to states as vanilla settings can result in a bit of a mess like Britain stating half their colonies and spamming automobile factories on the Falklands. The submod instead converts colonies by decision, this is not recommended to play with if you will play an unciv, the decision stating covers historical USA statehoods and Russia, which is tied to infrastructure inventions. It is not a finished mod but it is useful for those who find random stating annoying.
TGC Streamer Mod - This is for youtube creators, removes swastikas
